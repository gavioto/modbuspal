    <h1>Automation: create a new automation</h1>

    <h2>Add a new automation</h2>

    <p>In order to add an new automation to your project, just click on the
    "Add" button located in the "Automation" frame of the main panel. A new item
    is added at the end of the list of automations.</p>

    <p>The automation you have just created is empty, and thus will not generate
    any value. But you can bind your slaves' registers and coils to it anyway.</p>

    <h2>Automation's name</h2>

    <p>The name of the automation is important and you must pay attention to it
    because ModbusPal needs it to recognize what register/coil is bound to which
    automation. The consequence is that the name of an automation must be unique.
    You will notice that ModbusPal automatically generates unique names by adding
    a numeric value at the end of the "no name".</p>

    <p>You can change the name of the automation, but ModbusPal will always check
    that the name you type is not already used by another automation. If that's the
    case, it will automatically alter the name you've just typed in order to make
    it unique.</p>
