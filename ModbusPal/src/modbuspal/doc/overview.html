    <h1>ModbusPal overview</h1>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Modbus support: the current version only supports RTU Modbus over
        TCP/IP, and functions code 0x03 (read holding registers) and 0x10 (write
        multiple registers. A detailled description of the Modbus support is
        available <a href="modbus_support.html">here</a>.</li>

        <li>Learn mode: when the Learn mode is enabled, the application will
        automatically create new slaves and their registers on-the-fly when Modbus
        requests are received. This is a very efficient way to get started. More
        information on the Lean mode is available <a href="learn_mode.html">here</a>.</li>
