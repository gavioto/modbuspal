    <h1>Slaves: Editing registers and coils</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>By default, a modbus contains no register or coil. You have to create
    them manually or by activating the Lear mode. In this page we will see the
    manual mode.</p>

    <h2>Add</h2>

    <p>Clicking the "Add" button will pop up a dialog where you must specify the
    starting address and the quantity of registers/coils you want to add. They
    are created with "0" as a default value and no name to describe it.</p>

    <h2>Edit</h2>

    <p>You can double-click on the value or the name in order to modify it.
    Note that a register's value is comprised between 0 and 65535. A coil is
    either 0 or 1.</p>

    <h2>Remove</h2>

    <p>Select as many rows of the table as you want to delete, and then simply
    click on the "Remove" button.</p>

    <h2>Copy/Paste</h2>

    <p>If you edit your modbus slave's registers and coils very quickly by copying
    and pasting them. Select the rows you want to copy and press "CTRL+C". Then, select
    the rows where you want to paste the values and names, and press "CTRL+V".</p>
