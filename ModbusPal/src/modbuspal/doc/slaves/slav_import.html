    <h1>Slaves import and export</h1>

    <p>Even if you use the Learn Mode, configuring a Modbus slave can be
    long and boring. What will happen if you have many slaves of the same
    kind to configure ? You'll get bored to death unless you do it smartly.
    Once you have fully configured a Modbus slave, you can very easily
    duplicate it by using the import/export mechanism.</p>

    <h2>Export a slave</h2>

    <p>The first step is to open your slave's dialog by cliking on the desired
    "Show" button of the main window. Then, just click on the "Export" button.</p>

    <p>By default, only the static values of the registers/coils are
    exported, not the bindings. Importing only this data into a new slave
    would mean that the new slaves has no binding, and you have to do it
    by yourself.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, there are some options you can configure so that you
    export all the data you need.</p>

    <h3>Export with bindings</h3>

    <p>If you enable this option, your slave registers/coils will be exported
    with all the bindings that you have created. You can create a new slave
    in you current project and import this data, you'll have an exact copy of
    the slave you just exported.</p>

    <p>The tricky part is when you import that slave into another project. Remember
    that ModbusPal uses the names of the automations in order to recognize which
    register/coil is bound to which automation; if you import the bindings information,
    there may not be automations with matching names in your new project, and your
    imported slave would not work as expected.</p>

    <h3>Export with automations</h3>

    <p>If you enable this option, your slave is exported with bindings AND with
    the automations related to those bindings. This is the most convenient
    option if you want to import this data into another project, because you
    ensure that you do not lose any information.</p>

    <p>The drawback is that you have to be careful when importing this data, as
    you may erase already existing automations with the same names.</p>
