    <h1>RXTX project</h1>

    <p>ModbusPal relies on the RXTX project in order to provide support for
    serial ports.</p>
    
    <p>The RXTX communication API is made of a Java library and a native OS
    library. It offers the same interface as the Java Communications API.
    But, instead of Java Communications, all platforms are supported,
    primarily Windows and Linux.</p>

    <p>If you don't have RXTX communication API installed, ModbusPal will
    only offer TCP/IP support.</p>

    <p>Download and installation instructions: <a href="http://www.rxtx.org">http://www.rxtx.org</a></p>
