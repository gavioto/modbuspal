    <title>ModbusPal: quick start</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Quick start</h1>
    
    <p>This guide explains how to use ModbusPal in order to create a realistic
    simulation environment. First, the "Learn mode" will do must of the work. Then
    we will fine tune the environment by adding slaves, registers and automations
    manually.</p>

    <p>If you need to simulate Modbus slaves, it is probably because you have
    a real Modbus master device connected to your PC. The goal of ModbusPal is
    not to simulate a Modbus Master, even if a basic simulation will be provided
    in the future.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 1: Activate the link</h2>

    <p>Modbus protocol can be implemented over TCP/IP or Serial link, in RTU or
    ASCII mode. In this example, we will use RTU and TCP/IP. The only parameter
    of the TCP/IP link is the port number on which the Modbus requests will
    be received.</p>

    <p>The default port is 502. When you have chosen the appropriate port for
    your application, simply click on the "Run" button so that incoming
    Modbus requests are received and processed by ModbusPal.</p>

    <p>At the moment, your simulation environment contains no Modbus slave, so
    all incoming request will fail; error codes will be returned to the Modbus
    Master.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Use the Learn mode</h2>

    <p>The Modbus master is sending requests to your PC. Click on the "Learn"
    button in order to active the Learn mode.</p>

    <p>Now, when ModbusPal receives a Modbus requests, it examines this request and
    automatically creates any missing elements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If the request is addressed to a non-existant Modbus slave, then the
        Modbus slave is created.</li>
        <li>If the request is addressed to a non-existant register or coil, then the
        register or coil is created within the simulated slave (the default value
        is zero).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you are satisfied with the simulation environment, then you can
    disable the "Learn" mode. When it is disabled, ModbusPal will return error
    codes to the master if incoming requests are addressed to inexistant slaves,
    registers or coils.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Create an automation</h2>

    <p>The slaves that you have just created have zeroes in all their registers
    and coils. You could change those values, but it would  still be very static.
    Instead, we will create an automation that will generate dynamic values.</p>

    <p>The creation of an automation is very simple. Just click on the "Add" button
    in the "Automation" frame, and it' done. Of course, it won't generate values
    at the moment, because you didn't specify how to do it yet.</p>

    <p>Generating values is made by predefinied formulaes (called "Generators")
    that you put into the automation object. To do so, click on the "Show"
    button of the automation. A new window will appear, which represents the
    content of the automation. It is empty at the moment.</p>

    <p>To add a generator, just click on its name in the "Generators" button
    panel. The generator is added at the end of the list. You can add as many
    generators as you want. Each generator will be executed during 10 seconds
    by default (you can change this duration for each generator). When the last
    generator of the list is executed, the automation will stop unless you have
    enabled the "Loop" toggle button. In that case, the execution will resume
    at the beginning of the generators' list.</p>

    <p>Do not forget to click on the "Play" button in order to start the execution
    of the automation.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Customize your slaves</h2>

    <p>Now we have some slaves and a generator which creates dynamic values. We
    have to see how to bind a slave's register with an automation, and how to
    change manually the values of registers.</p>

    <p>If it is not opened yet, click on the "Show" button of your slave. Select
    one or more registers that you want to associate ("bind") with the automation
    and click on the "Bind" button.</p>

    <p>A new window appears; you must select the automation you're interested in
    and the bindings parameters. Then click on "OK" and it's done! Now those
    registers will get their value from the automation.</p>

    <p>You can also simply edit the values of the registers by double-clicking
    on them.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Add a new slave manually</h2>

    <p>If you want to add a new slave without relying on the "Learn mode", you
    have to click on the "Add" button of the "Modbus slaves" panel. You're invited
    to choose a modbus slave number and type a name.</p>

    <p>Newly created modbus slaves do not contain any register or coil. You can
    create them manually, let the Learn mode do it, or import them from a
    project file or an export file.</p>

    <p>Click on the "show" button of the modbus slave you're interested in. In the
    new window, select the "holding registers" tab if you want to create holding
    registers; then click on the "Add" button and choose the range of register
    addresses you want to create. The registers are created with 0 default value.</p>

    <h2>Done!</h2>

    <p>That's it! You have learned the most important things about ModbusPal. You
    can save your project by using the "Save" button of the "Project" panel.</p>
