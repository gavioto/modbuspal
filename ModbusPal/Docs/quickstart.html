    <h1>ModbusPal: Quick start</h1>

    <p>Using ModbusPal can be very easy: click on the "Run" button to start
    processing incoming Modbus requests, and click on the "Learn" button to
    create and configure Modbus slaves on-the-fly.</p>

    <h2>Links</h2>

    <p>Modbus protocol can be implemented over TCP/IP or serial link. The
    current version of ModbusPal only implements TCP/IP, but in the future
    I plan to offer serial communication management.</p>

    <h3>TCP/IP</h3>

    <p>Before you click on the "Run" button, you may want to modify the TCP port
    on which the application will received incoming connections. The default
    Modbus port is 502, but you can use any other available port. There is no
    other configuration to worry about!</p>

    <h2>"Normal" mode (as opposed to "Learn" mode)</h2>

    <p>At the beginning, your project contains no Modbus slave. It means that
    any incoming request will receive no reply. You create new Modbus slaves
    by clicking on the "Add" button in the "Modbus slaves" panel.</p>

    <p>Once a Modbus slave is added, it can reply to Modbus requests. But
    it contains no registers nor coils: the Modbus slave will reply with
    error codes. You have to click on the "Show" button of the Modbus slave
    and define all registers or coils that you need to simulate.</p>

    <p>This procedure can be very tiring if you want to simulate a lot
    of Modbus slave, even if you can spare a lot of time with the "Export" and
    "Import" features. You really should have a look at the "Learn" mode...</p>

    <h2>"Learn" mode</h2>

    <p>This mode helps you to build your project very quickly. When "Learn"
    mode is enabled and you receive a Modbus request :
    <ul>
        <li>If the target slave doesn't exist, it is created</li>
        <li>If the desired register or coil doesn't exist, it is created</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
